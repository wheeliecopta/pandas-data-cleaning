Repository Structure:

    Create a New Repository:
        Start by creating a new repository on GitHub.

    README.md:
        Write a detailed README file to provide an overview of your project. Include:
            Project title and description
            Brief explanation of the problem or objective
            List of libraries used
            Instructions on how to run the code
            Any other relevant information about the project

    Scripts:
        Create a folder for each of the three steps you mentioned (Cleaning, Quality Control, Analysis).
        Inside each folder, organize your scripts logically. For example:
            cleaning_script.py
            quality_control_script.py
            analysis_script.py

    Notebooks:
        If you used Jupyter Notebooks, consider creating a separate folder for them.
        Name them appropriately, like cleaning_notebook.ipynb, quality_control_notebook.ipynb, etc.

    Data:
        If your dataset is not too large, you can include it in the repository.
        Create a data folder and place your dataset inside.

    Presentation:
        Create a folder for presentations, e.g., presentation.
        Include your presentation file (e.g., project_presentation.pdf or project_presentation.pptx).

    Contributors:
        If not already present, create a CONTRIBUTORS.md file to acknowledge the contributions of each team member. List who worked on which part of the project

README.md:

    Introduction:
        Briefly introduce the project, its purpose, and the problem it addresses.

    Directory Structure:
        Explain the organization of your repository.

    Dependencies:
        List the required dependencies (e.g., Python version, pandas version).

    Instructions:
        Provide step-by-step instructions on how to run the scripts or notebooks.

    Acknowledgments:
        Acknowledge the contributions of your team members.

    Contact:
